/**
 * Contract for concrete event handlers.
 * <p>
 * Event handlers can handle an event with different "consequences". Two aspects may be important :
 * <ul>
 * <li>Is it a problem if the handler does its thing multiple times with a given event, e.g. during a retry-loop or after recovery etc?</li>
 * <li>Is the handler prepared to actually do something with the event (and afterwards, did it actually do it)?</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The first aspect is reflected in the <code>HandleType</code> that the handler must return from <code>EventHandler.canHandleAs()</code>.
 * A <code>FUNCTIONAL</code> handling can be considered as repeatable without significant negative consequences.
 * A handling with <code>EFFECT</code> implies that this handler's event processing should be considered as the singular "processing-with-real-impact".
 * This implies that no other handlers-with-EFFECT can be allowed to handle this event anymore, nor can a retry be attempted.
 * Only further <code>FUNCTIONAL</code> event-handling can still be done after an <code>EFFECT</code> handler has actually processed the event.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For the second aspect, a combination of the <code>HandleType</code> returned by <code>EventHandler.canHandleAs()</code>, 
 * and the <code>HandleResult</code> returned by <code>EventHandler.handle()</code> (after it has been invoked) must be considered.<br/> 
 * <code>HandleType.SKIP</code> means that the given handler is not interested in the event, or not capable of handling it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By returning SKIP, the handler is guaranteed that the event dispatcher will not invoke <code>EventHandler.handle()</code> for the given event.
 * When the handler has not returned SKIP, its <code>EventHandler.handle()</code> will actually be invoked some time later.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the handling was successful, the handler should return <code>DONE</code>.
 * <br/>
 * It could still happen that the handler is, at the exact time when its <code>handle()</code> is invoked, not able to handle the event. 
 * E.g. because its underlying resource (like an actor) is already occupied. Then the handler should return one of two outcomes :
 * <ul>
 * <li>SKIPPED : indicates that no processing was done, but the handler is OK with this.</li>
 * <li>RETRY : indicates that no processing was done, and the handler would like to get a next shot at it, a bit later.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
