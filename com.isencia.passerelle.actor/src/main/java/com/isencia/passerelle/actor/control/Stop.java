/**
 * SLIGHT VARIATION ON THE PTOLEMY STOP ACTOR, FOR PASSERELLE: STOPS MODEL
 * EXECUTION ON RECEIVING ANY KIND OF MESSAGE, NOT JUST TRUE TOKENS... An actor
 * that stops execution of a model when it receives a true token on any input
 * channel. This is accomplished by calling finish() on the manager, which
 * requests that the current iteration be completed and then the model execution
 * be halted. If the input is not connected to anything, then this actor
 * requests a stop whenever it fires.
 * <p>
 * When exactly this stops the execution depends on the domain. For example, in
 * DE, if an event with time stamp <i>T</i> and value <i>true</i> arrives at
 * this actor, then the current iteration will be concluded, and then the model
 * will halt. Concluding the current iteration means processing all events in
 * the event queue with time stamp <i>T</i>. Thus, it is possible for actors to
 * be invoked after this one is invoked with a <i>true</i> input.
 * <p>
 * In SDF, if this actor receives <i>true</i>, then the current iteration is
 * concluded and then execution is stopped. Similarly in SR.
 * <p>
 * In PN, where each actor has its own thread, there is no well-defined notion
 * of an iteration. The finish() method of the manager calls stopFire() on all
 * actors, which for threaded actors results in halting them upon their next
 * attempt to read an input or write an output. When all actor threads have
 * stopped, the iteration concludes and the model halts. <b>NOTE</b>: <i>This is
 * not the best way to stop a PN model!</i> This mechanism is nondeterministic
 * in the sense that there is no way to control exactly what data is produced or
 * consumed on the connections before the model stops. To stop a PN model, it is
 * better to design the model so that all actors are starved of data when the
 * model is to stop. The director will detect this starvation, and halt the
 * model. Nonetheless, if the nondeterminism is acceptable, this actor can be
 * used.
