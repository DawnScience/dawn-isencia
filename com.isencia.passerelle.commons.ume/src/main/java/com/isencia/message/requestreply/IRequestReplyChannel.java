 * request and sending a reply (e.g. a socket receiver channel and a file sender
 * channel). In practice this does not really make a lot of sense, and most
 * often we will receive and send msgs via similar channels. In such cases, this
 * contract should be used. It extends IReceiverChannel with some methods
 * adapted to request/reply semantics.
