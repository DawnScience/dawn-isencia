 * Contract for OSGi services (or other impls) that define the 
 * ordered list of TypeConverters to be used by a Passerelle engine impl.
 * 
 * Remark that the intention is that the returned list of TypeConverters can be modified
 * at runtime. I.e. someone can add to/remove from/reorder it and from then onwards Passerelle
 * will be using the modified list!
 * 
 * Access to the currently active TypeConverterProvider implementation depends on the environment.
 * It is always possible via <code>TypeConversionChain.getConverterProvider()</code>.
 * Within an OSGi environment, the implementation will need to be available as an OSGi service,
 * so a service tracker can be used to access it.
