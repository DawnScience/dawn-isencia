 * Implementations will typically implement some kind of filtering on the presented errors.
 * If a handler is not willing/capable to handle a given error, the engine will try to offer the error to other handlers,
 * in a hierarchical way, i.e. starting from a sub-model-level upwards to parent levels up-to the top level.
