/**
 * PortMode represents whether a port should be polled
 * to see if a message is available, or whether the message should be pushed 
 * to an actor.
 * <p>
 * Remark that polling a port with <code>Port.get()</code> blocks until
 * a message is available or until the Port can be certain that no more
 * messages will ever arrive in the life of the current model.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since Passerelle v8.3, the AGNOSTIC mode has been added. 
 * This means that the engine should not assume anything about the Port semantics, 
 * and that the container component (typically an actor)
 * is responsible for any ad-hoc approach to obtain the messages from the input port.
 * </p>
